    "Inheritance is often related to the relationship between a parent and a child relationship of two functions.  However, there are several levels of types of inheritance that we can have. A single inheritance is an example of one child class and one parent. Multiple will have more than one parent class, multilevel, will have a child class that will also have a parent class. We can use code inheritance in order to learn how to re-use code or call a specific section of a function. So a parent function can withold all our information but the child function will allow us to recall it or be able to specifically call specific elements, and grab what we need. Example will be the first name, last name example in class, the first name is the parent function the child function is the full name. "
