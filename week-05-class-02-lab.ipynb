    "The time complexity of the following code, I believe is o(n^3). The reason I believe, it is o(n^3), is because when running the program it is ineffecient. When running the program, we are able to see that the first loop goes through element oof the given arguments and intakes it length and subtracts it by 1. It then prints how many indexes are within that list, then there is a second function that is in a nested loop that prompts the same thing when I ran it, this set back the index to 0 and printed it again, this is an example of binary search as it searches for elements that were already pre-existent. Then the function contunies to nest through each index of the array and searches each one and appends it to the array. When I placed this into python visualization with an argument of 8 arguments it went through 456 steps to go through each index, and ran by it 3 times, it then printed the valued based on how many times it ran through each index. Overall, what makes the function time complexity o(n^3) is the 3 for loops that are each calling each other multiple times. "
